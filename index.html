        <h2>Plantiff</h2>
        <h3>Royal Lepage Team Realty Inc</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Seeking the 5% commision payment.</li>
          <li>“Dual agency” which means that they have to act in the best interest of the seller and buyer.</li>
          <li>Were at awe with the house condition and stated that the house was worth between $338,000 and $340,000.</li>
          <li>Mary Lindsay states that if they want a quick sale, it should not be listed above $330,000.</li>
          <li>Third party agent offered $302,000 and Mary Lindsay encouraged them to seriously consider the offer, which the plaintiff rejected.</li>
          <li>Another third party agent had a "serious offer"  of $315,000, which the plaintiffs were not interested in.</li>
          <li>Paul Williams, the husband of Kelly Williams who worked in the same office as the Lindsays, had an offer.</li>
          <li>Wrote on the offer that “The buyer, Paul Williams, is the spouse of Kelly Williams, the Royal Lepage Team Realty sales representative”.</li>
          <li>Did not use the name "Kelly Ellard" in the call with Karen. The court agrees that it may be due to the stress affecting Karen and Dan that they might have been confused.</li>
          <li>Overstepped authority and made an unapproved counter offer of $325,000 which was ratified by Karen and Dan.</li>

          <li>Karen and Dan had a "heated" discussion on the price to attempt to obtain the house at $329,500 rather than $320,000. </li>
